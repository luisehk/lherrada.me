This is article is a quick guide on how to setup a CI/CD pipeline for your Python project using Gitlab CI.\n\n## Continuous Integration\nContinuous Integration is the practice of integrating the work of a team of developers into a shared repository as frequently as possible. The goal is to detect and fix errors fast instead of waiting for things to pile up. When you're integrating code frequently (and by frequently I mean daily), you're basically de-risking your releases because of a very simple principle: less code to integrate == less things that can go wrong.\n\nThe key practices to do CI successfully are:\n* Integrate small and atomic branches into a shared repository\n* Before integrating, the entire application should be tested automatically\n* Everytime a branch is integrated, it should be built automatically\n* When the release is built, it should deploy automatically to a staging server\n\nIn other words: you should iterate fast and automate your process.\n\n## Continuous Delivery\nContinuous Delivery on the other hand is the practice of deploying your code to production as frequently as possible, with the goal of reducing the possibilities of something going wrong when releasing new features or bug fixes. Ideally, deployment should be done automatically.\n\nIn other words:\n* CI = merge frequently into master\n* CD = deploy master frequently to production\n\n## Automated testing\nWhen you're adding new code to the repository you **must** add unit or functional tests, this is key for having a sane CI/CD workflow. A lot of beginners think the main benefit of testing is knowing your code works, but the real benefit is that you're making sure if someone breaks your code *in the future* they know about it and fix their code (or your test).\n\nThis is why automated testing is so important, because if you're doing frequent integrations you need to make sure you're not breaking anything *every single time*. I won't cover unit and functional testing in this article, but if you want to get started with test-driven development you should start reading [Obey the testing goat!](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).\n\n## Pipeline stages\nIn this guide I use Gitlab CI to execute the pipeline everytime a branch is merged into master, but you're free to use a different service like CircleCI, TravisCI or Codeship.\n\nThink about a CI/CD pipeline as a set of jobs or stages that we execute everytime a new branch is being merged into master. In this guide we are running five stages: three for static code analysis, one for our test suite and one more to deploy our new release.\n\n#### 1. Flake8\nThis is a code analyzer to enforce code style rules like the pep8 specification. Running this is very straightforward:\n```\nflake8 --exclude='.git,venv,*migrations*,static/lib'\n```\n\nIf everything is great no output will be returned and the pipeline job will succeed, but if there are errors it will print something like this and return 1 as the exit code.\n\n![flake8 results](/static/img/cicd-python/flake8.png)\n\n#### 2. Radon\nThis is a Python tool to determine the cyclomatic complexity of our code, which means that this stage will throw an alert and fail if our code became too complex.\n\n```\nradon cc -s -a --ignore='venv' .\nradon mi -s --ignore='venv' .\n```\n\n![cyclomatic complexity](/static/img/cicd-python/cc.jpg)\n\n\n#### 3. Bandit\nThis is a tool originally developed by the OpenStack Security Project, it analyzes our code to find common security issues such as:\n* Use of assert\n* Hardcoded passwords\n* SQL injection\n* Binding to all interfaces\n* Weak cryptography\n* And many others\n\nYou can run bandit like this:\n\n```\nbandit -r --exclude='venv' .\n```\n\nYou can expect something like this if a vulnerability is found:\n\n![bandit](/static/img/cicd-python/bandit.png)\n\n\n#### 4. The test suite\nAfter all of the static analysis stages pass, it makes sense to run our test suite to see if we broke something.\n\n```\npython manage.py test -k -v 2\n```\n\n![pytest](/static/img/cicd-python/pytest.png)\n\n#### 5. Deployment\nThis is stage in particular deserves its own blog post because it is an extensive topic, there are a lot of strategies and you should take your time to choose the approach that suits you best.\n\nFirst, you have to decide: do you want to PUSH your release from the CI server to your server? or do you want your server to PULL your release whenever it is ready?\n\nFor a push strategy, you can:\n* Use [dpl](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/deployment/) for Heroku\n* Use [sshpass](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/noninteractive-shell-script-ssh-password-provider/) to remotely execute commands on your server\n* Build a push a Docker image to the Docker Registry and update your containers from whatever you're using (Rancher / k8s)\n\nFor a pull strategy, you can:\n* Have a cronjob that pulls your changes from Git and executes build.sh when it detects a new release.\n\n## Gitlab CI\nNow that you understand the idea behind CI pipelines and their stages, you just need to automate it. We can use Gitlab CI for this and instead of duplicating [their official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), I'll just an example of a .gitlab-ci.yml file that you can use for your project. Notice how I:\n* Establish what folders to cache between stages so I don't have to install the pip requirements everytime\n* Specify which image to run my pipeline on. Gitlab CI uses Docker for this.\n* Install the chrome driver to run Selenium for my functional tests, but only on my test stage.\n* Specify how Gitlab can retrieve the test coverage (reported by coverage.py)\n\n.gitlab-ci.yml:\n```\nimage: python:3.6\n\nservices:\n  - postgres:9.6\n  - redis:3.2\n\nvariables:\n  PIP_CACHE_DIR: \"$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/pip\"\n  POSTGRES_DB: myproject\n\ncache:\n  untracked: true\n  key: \"test\"\n  paths:\n    - .cache/pip\n    - venv/\n\nbefore_script:\n  - python --version\n  - pip install virtualenv\n  - virtualenv venv\n  - source venv/bin/activate\n  - pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nstages:\n  - pep8\n  - radon\n  - bandit\n  - test\n\npep8:\n  stage: pep8\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - .cache/pip\n      - venv\n  script:\n    - flake8 --exclude='.git,venv,*migrations*,static/lib' .\n\nradon:\n  stage: radon\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - .cache/pip\n      - venv\n  script:\n    - radon cc -s -a --ignore='venv' .\n    - radon mi -s --ignore='venv' .\n\nbandit:\n  stage: bandit\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - .cache/pip\n      - venv\n  script:\n    - bandit -r --exclude='venv' .\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  variables:\n    DATABASE_URL: \"postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/$POSTGRES_DB\"\n    DISPLAY: \":99\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - .cache/pip\n      - venv/\n  script:\n    - wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -\n    - sh -c 'echo \"deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" \u003e\u003e /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list'\n    - apt-get -y update\n    - apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable\n    - apt-get install -yqq unzip\n    - wget -O /tmp/chromedriver.zip http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/`curl -sS chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE`/chromedriver_linux64.zip\n    - unzip /tmp/chromedriver.zip chromedriver -d /usr/local/bin/\n    - python manage.py migrate auth\n    - python manage.py migrate sites\n    - python manage.py migrate\n    - python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\n    - coverage run manage.py test -v 2\n    - coverage report\n  coverage: '/TOTAL.+ ([0-9]{1,3}%)/'\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nMore than a tool, CI/CD is a set of tools and practices to allow your team be more productive and focus on the fun and creative parts of the job. Adopting CI/CD is the first step into reducing risks on your releases and quickly adapting to business requirements and user needs.\n","data":{"id":3,"title":"A sane CI/CD setup for Python","thumbnail":"/static/img/hack-capital.jpg","date":"June 14, 2019","length":"5 min read","category":"devops","description":"This is a quick guide on how to setup a sane CI/CD pipeline for your Python project using Gitlab CI and Docker, so you can spend your time on developing new features instead of stressing about fixing errors, merge conflicts and broken deployments."},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"03-sane-cicd-setup-python"},{"document":{"content":"Many companies are becoming remote-friendly or even remote-first. The benefits are great: more flexibility in your daily life, no commuting, the ability to work with world-class teams without having to move to Silicon Valley, etc. But you should also be aware of its challenges and understand it isn't for everybody.\n\nIts been 3 years since I founded [Vordem](https://vordem.io) as a remote-first company, and I'd like to share my experience both as a founder and a remote worker myself. This isn't supposed to be an article telling you should work remotely, it is more about sharing my experience and letting you make that choice.\n\n## Hiring\nOne of the key aspects of being remote-friendly is hiring because even if it allows you to hire great people from around the globe, you need to make sure they're not only good at their job but also good remote workers.\n\nThe main quality of a good remote worker is *written communication* because most of the communication will be through email, Slack, Github issues and Google Docs. Something that has worked for me is hiring people who have worked remotely before, and running the first steps of the hiring process through email to see their writing skills.\n\nAnother key point is hiring people you can trust. If you need to micromanage someone, it's already too late: you will need to let him go and the fault is all yours because you didn't hire carefully enough. Instead, you should hire doers: people who make things happen and don't need to be constantly supervised.\n\n## Collaboration\nGood written communication is a *must*, but it is also important to have good communication guidelines written and enforced. Why? Because remote working adds a communication overhead that needs to be managed or else it can create chaos.\n\nMost people think Slack will solve their communication needs, but since it is a real-time chat people expect an immediate response when talking to a colleague, which isn't a healthy way to collaborate and can kill productivity very easily.\n\nInstead, establish a tool for each kind of interaction. For example, here are some things that have worked for us:\n* You may use Trello for issue tracking and keep relevant conversation inside each card. Some people prefer Basecamp or Github Issues.\n* Use Slack for alerting and general conversation, but if important decisions are being made you should also notify everyone through email to keep them in the loop. They may not be reading Slack at that very moment.\n* Videoconference for daily standups works wonders at it is very good for bonding.\n* Turn your camera on videoconference. Your body language says a lot and it also reminds people there is a human behind that username.\n* If you're not speaking, mute your microphone. I wish I didn't need to say this but people struggle with this at first.\n* Don't ask to ask, just ASK. People will respond when they have the chance.\n* Don't ask for a Google Meet or a phone call right away. Be respectful of your coworker's time and tell them what the problem is first. They may give you a written answer without having to stop what they were doing.\n* Don't wait for a document to be finished before sharing. Just put everything in a shared folder so everyone can find anything without depending on someone else.\n\n## Remote work does not mean working independently\nThe ability to work independently is the wrong motivation when looking for remote work. I say this because when I started hiring I found a lot of people who wanted to work their own hours, not having to report status to anyone and showed hesitation to adapt to the collaboration guidelines.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, people shouldn't need to tell when they're working and you should hire people you can trust, but remote work isn't a replacement for collaborating and communicating with a team. So ask yourself: what's the motivation behind your pursuit of remote work and how does it benefit your team?\n\n## Being an efficient and sane remote worker\nWorking remotely usually means working from home, and since people usually separate their work and personal lives by going to an office, it can be a real challenge for remote workers.\n\n#### 1. Don't work on your pajamas\nIt may be tempting to work from your pajamas, but you need to dress for work to get into the right mindset and be productive. Also, take into account that you may need to turn your webcam on.\n\n#### 2. Don't work in your bedroom\nYou should design a space that is dedicated to working, comfortable and free of distractions. Working from the couch or your bed may be tempting but your brain will relate them to work and your ability to rest will be affected.\n\n#### 3. Establish rules with your family\nIf you have a spouse or children, they will naturally think you're available since you're home but that's not the case: you're working. You'll need to talk to them and establish some rules to avoid constant interruptions.\n\n#### 4. Working from home != Working less\nOne common misconception about remote work is that you'll work less, but that's not the case at all. Just because you don't have people looking at your screen doesn't mean you can procrastinate. Remember: you have a team that trusts you on delivering your part just like in any on-site job... you just happen to do it from home.\n\n#### 5. Separate work/life at home\nDon't use your home office for leisure and establish a strict work schedule so it's easy for you to tell when you're at work and when you're not. It's important for your mental health to make the distinction so you're able to relax. Long hours are strictly forbidden.\n\n#### 6. Get out of the house\nIf you're an introvert or you're not an outdoors guy, it's very easy to spend weeks without leaving your house when working from home. But going out and talking to people face-to-face help us de-stress, so don't forget to see your friends or go to events and meet new people. It also helps to occasionally work from a coffee shop or a coworking space.\n\n## Conclusion\nRemote working is being implemented in more companies every year, it works and it has plenty of benefits, but you should also know about its challenges and how to overcome them. To make it work  everyone in the team has to be a great communicator and self-organizing.\n","data":{"id":2,"title":"Running a remote team","thumbnail":"/static/img/glitch.png","date":"June 11, 2019","length":"5 min read","category":"remote","description":"Many companies are becoming remote-friendly or even remote-first, and that's great news for everybody.

a computer connected to the internet and a lot of free time as a teenager, helped me develop multiple skills like playing the guitar, develop web applications, design websites and be good at videogames. To most people, that would be a big achievement and they always told me the same thing: I wish I could be as good at \u003ccoding / the guitar\u003e as you are.\n\nMy response to them was always the same: just start and keep practicing. I also explained that you start by being bad at something but that's part of the process and with practice you get better and better, but it seemed like they thought I wasn't sharing some secret tip or that I was born with that talent, so they didn't follow my advice and eventually gave up trying.\n\nToday, I'm not as good as a guitarist as I was (because I stopped practicing), but I've been doing software engineering for 11 years and learned a lot of things during this journey, not only on the technical side but also on how to run a company, build technical teams, keep your sanity as a developer, work with people from other disciplines, among other things that I think can be useful to someone else.\n\nLike most people, I've given talks at local meetups, offered tech consultancy to clients and discussed interesting topics with friends over beers, not only as a way to expand my network but mainly because I genuinely enjoy sharing with others. That's why I've always wanted to start blog but would easily get discouraged thinking I'm not as good as other people, or that writing is hard and takes a lot of time (which is true), and eventually found myself saying: I've always wanted to write, I wish I was good at it.\n\nThen I realized I needed to follow the same advice I previously gave to others: just start and keep practicing. I don't need to wait until I'm a great writer or the best engineer in the world, I just have to select a list of topics I want to write about and start doing so. The first articles will probably be bad but that's ok... that's what the practice is for.\n\nSo this is me, following the advice of just starting.\n","data":{"id":1,"title":"Just start and keep practicing","thumbnail":"/static/img/subway-lines.jpg","date":"June 10, 2019","length":"2 min read","category":"meta","description":"Like most people, I've always wanted to start blog but would easily get discouraged thinking I'm not as good as other people, or that writing is hard (which is true), and eventually found myself saying: I've always wanted to write, I wish I was good at it."},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"01-just-start-and-keep-practicing"}]}},"page":"/blog","query":{},"buildId":"cuBJ4qdFcebHaAIydnZZP","dynamicBuildId":false,"nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/blog" src="/_next/static/cuBJ4qdFcebHaAIydnZZP/pages/blog.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/cuBJ4qdFcebHaAIydnZZP/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-91090225b59433409ab6.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.ea39294d8d5dccf83ff1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-45a5e2a432a79f23ce33.js" async=""></script></body></html>
