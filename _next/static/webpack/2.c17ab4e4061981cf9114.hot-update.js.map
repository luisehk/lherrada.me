The benefits are great: more flexibility in your daily life, no commute, the ability work with world-class teams without having to move to Silicon Valley, etc. But you should also be aware of its challenges and understand it isn't for everybody.\\n\\nIts been 3 years since I founded [Vordem](https://vordem.io) as a remote-first company, and I'd like to share my experience both as a founder and a remote worker myself. This isn't supposed to be an article telling you should work remotely, it is more about sharing my experience and letting you make that choice.\\n\\n## Hiring\\nOne of the key aspects of being remote-friendly is hiring, because even if it allows you to hire great people from around the globe, you need to make sure they're not only good at their job but also good remote workers.\\n\\nThe main quality of a good remote worker is *written communication*, because most of the communication will be through email, Slack, Github issues and Google docs. Something that has worked for me is hiring people who have worked remotely before, and running the first steps of the hiring process through email to see their writing skills.\\n\\nAnother key point is hiring people you can trust. If you need to micromanage someone, its already too late: you will need to let him go and the fault is all yours because you didn't hire carefully enough. Instead, you should hire doers: people who make things happen and don't need to be constantly supervised.\\n\\n## Communication\\nGood written communication is a *must*, but it is also important to have good communication guidelines written and enforced. Why? Because remote working adds a communication overhead that needs to be managed or else it can create chaos.\\n\\nMost people use Slack nowadays for their internal communication, but since it is a real-time chat most people expect an immediate response when talking to a colleague, which isn't a healthy way to collaborate and can kill productivity very easily.\\n\\nand a lot of people aren't good at that. A remote team will consist of people with\\n\\n\\n## Communication\\nAsynchronous\\nWritten\\nSlack\\nVideo conference\\n\\n\\n## Practical tips\\n### 1. Don't work on your pajamas\\n\\n\\n### 2.
