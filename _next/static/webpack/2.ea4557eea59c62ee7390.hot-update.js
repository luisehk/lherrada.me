The benefits are great: more flexibility in your daily life, no commute, the ability work with world-class teams without having to move to Silicon Valley, etc. But you should also be aware of its challenges and understand it isn't for everybody.\n\nIts been 3 years since I founded [Vordem](https://vordem.io) as a remote-first company, and I'd like to share my experience both as a founder and a remote worker myself. This isn't supposed to be an article telling you should work remotely, it is more about sharing my experience and letting you make that choice.\n\n## Hiring\nOne of the key aspects of being remote-friendly is hiring, because even if it allows you to hire great people from around the globe, you need to make sure they're not only good at their job but also good remote workers.\n\nThe main quality of a good remote worker is *written communication*, and a lot of people aren't good at that.\n\n\n## Practical tips\n### 1. Don't work on your pajamas\n\n\n### 2. Working from home != Working less\n\n\n### 3. Don't work on your bedroom\n\n\n### 4. Don't forget to take a break\n\n\n### 5. Don't forget to get out\n\n\n### 6. Establish rules for communication\n\n\n### 7.\n");
